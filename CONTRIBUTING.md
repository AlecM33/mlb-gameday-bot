To set up the application locally, see the README section "Running Locally + Contributing".

When opening issues, try to be as descriptive and specific as possible in regards to what you want and why.

When opening Pull Requests, it is expected that the work be linked to an existing Issue, and that there is a sufficient documented testing plan.

Thanks for taking a look at this project! I'm happy to answer any questions or field any suggestions for improvements or new features.
