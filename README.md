# MLB Gameday Bot âš¾
A bot that integrates with the MLB Stats API to track your team of choice. For me, it's the Cleveland Guardians.

Upon startup, the bot looks for your team's games in a 48-hour window centered on the current date. Whichever game (or games, in the case of a doubleheader) is the closest to the current date is
set as the "current" game, and will be the game for which a lot of the commands returns data. Slash Commands include:

- **/starters** - look at the starting pitching matchup for the current game. Includes portraits of both starters, their W/L, ERA, and WHIP, and a list of the pitches they throw.
- **/standings** - check the standings for your team's division. 
- **/lineup** - view the lineup card for the current game.
- **/line_score** - view the line score for the current game. 
- **/box_score** - view the box score for the current game, including hitting and pitching stats.
- **/scoring_plays** - get a curated list of scoring plays, with direct links to the play on the Gameday page.
- **/highlights** - get a curated list of direct links to key plays from the game. The links provide high quality videos.
- **/gameday_subscribe** - subscribe a given Discord channel to receive real-time updates from the "Gameday" feed! This command is restricted to certain roles. The bot connects to Gameday via a WebSocket and pushes events to each subscribed channel. This will report
                      the result of each at bat, as well as other key events such as steals or pitching changes. The message includes a description of the play, any change in score, and statcast metrics for balls in play.
- **/gameday_unsubscribe** - un-subscribe a given Discord channel from the above functionality.
- **/schedule** - view the upcoming schedule for the next week of games.
- **/batter** - view stats on the batter that is up right now. Only available when a game is live.
- **/pitcher** - view stats on the pitcher that is pitching right now. Only available when a game is live.
- **/weather** - view the weather for current the game.
- **/attendance** - view the attendance for the current game.

...and likely more to follow!

# Tech Stack

Written in JavaScript using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

The bot uses a PostgreSQL database hosted for free on the [Aiven Platform](https://aiven.io/) to keep track of the Discord channels that have subscribed to the real-time gameday feature.

I make use of several useful npm packages such as `sharp`, `ascii-table`, and `reconnecting-websocket`.

I integrate with the MLB stats API for a dizzying amount of data. Its documentation is limited, but there is some. Shout out to Todd Roberts and his project for getting me acquainted with some of the subtleties: https://pypi.org/project/MLB-StatsAPI/. You can also
view the spec for the MLB's "master game object", nicknamed GUMBO, here: https://bdata-research-blog-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/03/GUMBOPDF3-29.pdf. I'm also happy to answer what I can about how to use the API.

# Using the bot for your own servers

My instance of the bot for the Cleveland Guardians is private. The bot is only designed to follow one team at a time. If you are interested in running this bot in your own server, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to help get you started. Read below for a short overview of running your own instance.

# Running Locally + Contributing

This will assume you are somewhat familiar with Node.js and developing Discord bots.

The bot is dependent on a short list of environment variables. When these are populated appropriately, simply running `npm start` or your own Node command should get the bot running fine. These variables are:

- CLIENT_ID - your bot's client ID, AKA application ID.
- DATABASE_STRING - a connection string for a PostgreSQL database instance. That database should have the schema contained here in the file `db/schema.sql`. 
- LOG_LEVEL - your chosen log level. 
- TEAM_ID - the team you want to follow. These match those of the "teams" resource in the MLB stats API: https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/teams?sportId=1 . They are also stored statically in `config/globals.js`. Every command will be configured for that team.
- TOKEN - your bot's authentication token. **Obligatory 'this is sensitive' - be careful where you store it**

If the bot starts up successfully, the start-up logs look something like the following (subject to your log level). In this case, a game is live:
